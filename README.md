# Remix-DevTools

This package re-exports the already exiting [`remix-development-tools`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remix-development-tools) package by [Alem Tuzlak](https://github.com/AlemTuzlak).

The version of this package will always be the same as the version of the `remix-development-tools` package.

Originally I wanted to build the devtools but I realized that it was already built and published on npm. So I decided to just re-export it and support the developer.
